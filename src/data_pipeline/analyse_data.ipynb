However, AI also poses ethical, legal, and social risks (Jiang et al. 2021), such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, patient safety, and environmental impact (Stahl et al. 2023). The WHO has pub- lished two reports on the use of AI systems in healthcare, respectively in 2021 and 2023 (WHO 2021, 2023).

Essentially, AI in healthcare refers to the use of machine learning algorithms and other cognitive technologies to assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and overall management of patient care. One of the main factors driving the adoption of AI in healthcare is the overwhelming volume and complexity of medical data generated by the introduction of electronic health records (EHRs), imaging technologies, genomic data, and real-time patient monitoring.
