    "abstract": "The semiconductor industry stands at the center of the intensifying Sino-American trade conflict. Employing a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium modeling framework with imperfect competition and heterogeneous firms, we perform qualitative and quantitative analyses of protec-tionist semiconductor measures. The paper offers two innovations in assessing the macroeconomic impact of current trade restrictions in the semiconductor industry model. First, our model of the semiconductor industry takes into account semiconductor varieties at different technological levels with different substitutability. Second, we model trade restrictions using a novel approach to export bans on semiconductor varieties that is consistent with US policy. Our simulation results suggest that the trade restrictions imposed by the US and its allies consistently lead to a decline in Chinese GDP and welfare. The US also loses, but to a lesser extent. The effect of trade diversion favors the rest of the world. Our simulations further confirm that the US semiconductor industry is likely to be harmed by the restrictions, while China\u2019s could be strengthened.",

    "abstract": "This study empirically investigates the impact of recent US export controls on China on South Korea\u2019s semiconductor exports. We analyze South Korean export data to shed light on the repercussions of US export restrictions on a third country. Our findings reveal a significant decline in Korean semiconductor exports following the October 2022 imposition of US controls. This decline was most pronounced in the memory, discrete devices, and discrete device components subsectors of the semiconductor industry. In addition, we observed a decrease in unit prices, especially for memory semiconductors, pointing to downward pressure on South Korea\u2019s high-value-added semiconductor exports. These results provide some evidence of substantial negative impacts of US export controls on South Korea\u2019s semiconductor industry, and particularly with regard to its high-tech products.",

The Abe Administration announced that these measures were necessary to \u201censure non-proliferation of weapons-related materials.\u201d However, it is widely suspected that these measures were adopted as a retaliation against the Korean Supreme Court\u2019s decision recognizing compensation for the forced labor victims during the Japanese occupation period. The Korean government filed a complaint concerning these measures at the WTO DSB for resolution under international law. In this research, the authors will critically analyze Japan\u2019s export restrictions under international law to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current conflict. This paper will tackle the relevant issues under the WTO/GATT regulations and the Korea-Japan Claims Agreement to address the issue of who violated international law.",

    "abstract": "Amidst the escalating global competition in semiconductor technology, this paper critically examines the vulnerabilities and strengths of China\u2019s chip industry supply chain, juxtaposed against the backdrop of stringent U.S. export restrictions. Recognizing the strategic importance of semiconductors in national security and economic development, we delve into the nuanced dynamics of the ongoing trade conflict between Huawei and Qualcomm, two industry giants representing different continents. This analysis uncovers the root causes of the confrontation, highlighting the interplay between technological prowess and geopolitical strategies.Drawing upon extensive literature review and case studies, our research underscores the imperative for China to fortify its domestic chip ecosystem. We propose a multifaceted approach to optimize the supply chain, aiming to mitigate dependencies that exacerbate trade tensions. This strategy encompasses nurturing indigenous innovation, enhancing collaboration among stakeholders, and diversifying sourcing channels.The paper acknowledges its limitations, primarily the evolving nature of U.S. policies and the inherent challenges in accessing comprehensive data on proprietary technologies. Future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring of policy shifts and the cultivation of a more transparent information exchange framework between competing nations.",

    "abstract": "In July 2023 Japan\u2019s latest export tightening regulations on semiconductor manufacturing equipment took effect. These export regulations, implemented in coordination with the United States and the Netherlands, are significant in several respects: they have direct legal and potentially financial implications for Japan\u2019s leading equipment suppliers, they represent a departure from Japan\u2019s past approach of implementing in domestic law only those restrictions found in multilateral control lists, and the efficacy of these regulations in achieving their aims is as yet uncertain. Exporters may need to apply for one or more export licenses in order to comply with these regulations, or to try to take advantage of certain exemptions allowed by the law, such as the low-value goods exemption. As these regulations (and related regulations in the United States) are complex, effectively addressing their consequences will require market participants to take a detail-oriented and proactive approach. In the short term, various forces, including these regulations, appear to be driving on-shoring and decoupling of production: multiple Japanese and foreign parties are already investing billions in new semiconductor production in Japan.\nSemiconductors, Japan, Export Control, Chips, Control List, Lithography, Plurilateral Agreements",

    "abstract": "The US-China trade war forced a reluctant semiconductor industry into someone else\u2019s fight, a very different position from its leading role in the 1980s trade conflict with Japan. This paper describes how the political economy of the global semiconductor industry has evolved since the 1980s. That includes both a shift in the business model behind how semiconductors go from conception to a finished product as well as the geographic reorientation toward Asia of demand and manufactured supply. It uses that lens to explain how, during the modern conflict with China, US policymakers turned to a legally complex set of export restrictions targeting the semiconductor supply chain in the attempt to safeguard critical infrastructure in the telecommunications sector. The potentially far-reaching tactics included weaponization of exports by relatively small but highly specialized American software service and equipment providers in order to constrain Huawei, a Fortune Global 500 company. It describes potential costs of such policies, some of their unintended consequences, and whether policymakers might push them further in the attempt to constrain other Chinese firms.",

    "abstract": "The resurgence of global trade protectionism, characterized by rising tariffs, export controls, and geopolitical disputes, has significantly impacted global supply chain strategies. Major economic confrontations, such as the U.S.-China trade war, Brexit, and semiconductor export restrictions, have disrupted global sourcing models, increased operational costs, and introduced new layers of uncertainty. These disruptions have forced supply chain leaders to reconsider their dependency on globalized networks and explore strategic responses such as nearshoring, supplier diversification, and digital risk modeling. This paper examines the implications of global trade tariffs on supply chain structures and operations, with a focus on adaptive strategies, leadership decision-making, and regulatory considerations. By analyzing recent case studies and academic research, this study provides a framework for managing tariff-related risks and building resilient, future-ready supply chains.",
