    "abstract": "The semiconductor industry stands at the center of the intensifying Sino-American trade conflict. Employing a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium modeling framework with imperfect competition and heterogeneous firms, we perform qualitative and quantitative analyses of protec-tionist semiconductor measures. The paper offers two innovations in assessing the macroeconomic impact of current trade restrictions in the semiconductor industry model. First, our model of the semiconductor industry takes into account semiconductor varieties at different technological levels with different substitutability. Second, we model trade restrictions using a novel approach to export bans on semiconductor varieties that is consistent with US policy. Our simulation results suggest that the trade restrictions imposed by the US and its allies consistently lead to a decline in Chinese GDP and welfare. The US also loses, but to a lesser extent. The effect of trade diversion favors the rest of the world. Our simulations further confirm that the US semiconductor industry is likely to be harmed by the restrictions, while China\u2019s could be strengthened.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes South Korea's strategic responses to Japan's 2019 export restrictions on three key chemicals vital to its semiconductor industry: fluorinated polyimide, photoresist, and hydrogen fluoride. Beyond filing a WTO complaint, South Korea pursued retaliatory actions\u2014tightening trade regulations and initiating boycott movements\u2014while strengthening its semiconductor sector through funding, tax incentives, and cross-sector collaboration. Employing a neo-Mercantilist framework and qualitative method, this research highlights how state-led industrial strategies serve as a tool of economic resilience and foreign policy, contributing to broader discussions in International Political Economy on government agencies in navigating trade disputes and securing technological sovereignty.",

    "abstract": "This study empirically investigates the impact of recent US export controls on China on South Korea\u2019s semiconductor exports. We analyze South Korean export data to shed light on the repercussions of US export restrictions on a third country. Our findings reveal a significant decline in Korean semiconductor exports following the October 2022 imposition of US controls. This decline was most pronounced in the memory, discrete devices, and discrete device components subsectors of the semiconductor industry. In addition, we observed a decrease in unit prices, especially for memory semiconductors, pointing to downward pressure on South Korea\u2019s high-value-added semiconductor exports. These results provide some evidence of substantial negative impacts of US export controls on South Korea\u2019s semiconductor industry, and particularly with regard to its high-tech products.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews US semiconductor export controls on China and argues that, with a second Trump administration\u2014particularly regarding advanced process nodes and artificial intelligence (AI) chips\u2014those restrictions will tighten even further. In response, China has ramped up investments across its entire semiconductor ecosystem, steadily enhancing self-sufficiency at every stage of the supply chain. Looking ahead, China\u2019s global influence in the mature-process chip sector is expected to continue growing. In addition, it is likely to prioritise the development of next-generation semiconductor technologies while promoting the expansion of digital ecosystems centred on Chinese semiconductors throughout the Global South.",

    "abstract": "Tensions are high between Korea and Japan as a result of Japan\u2019s export restrictions on three essential semiconductor materials exported to Korea and the removal of South Korea from their White List of countries. The Abe Administration announced that these measures were necessary to \u201censure non-proliferation of weapons-related materials.\u201d However, it is widely suspected that these measures were adopted as a retaliation against the Korean Supreme Court\u2019s decision recognizing compensation for the forced labor victims during the Japanese occupation period. The Korean government filed a complaint concerning these measures at the WTO DSB for resolution under international law. In this research, the authors will critically analyze Japan\u2019s export restrictions under international law to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the current conflict. This paper will tackle the relevant issues under the WTO/GATT regulations and the Korea-Japan Claims Agreement to address the issue of who violated international law.",
